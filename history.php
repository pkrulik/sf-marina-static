                    <h2>From 1918 to Present</h2>
                    <p>SF Marina System USA is based in Gloucester VA  and is partnered with SF Marina Systems
                    international in  Gothenburg, Sweden, with representatives in more than thirty countries. We are a 
                    world-wide network of specialists selling and producing concrete floating structures.   The 
                    companyâ€™s heritage dates back to 1918 in Sweden, where the early designs and product 
                    development began, Just a few years later Concrete floating docks were in production.  SF 
                    Marina Systems has been advancing the designs and technology of floating dock breakwaters 
                    some including the creation of  floating breakwater pontoons in the 1980s starting with a 3m 
                    floating breakwater design and evolving to include 4m, 5m ,and 6, widths.  We now offer floating 
                    breakwaters up top 10 m wide. Which are 3.6m tall, and 40m long.  These advancements have 
                    translated directly to the  quality and designs of marina dock systems and industrial systems.
                    The next advancement is the use of non-metallic reinforcement for the floating concrete 
                    structures.  The use of Basalt rebar is a great advancement that will greatly increase the life 
                    spans of concrete docks, which could last a century..</p>
