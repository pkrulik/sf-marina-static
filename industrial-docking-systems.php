                        <p>Calonnas Shipyard in Norfolk Va is  an industry leading shipyard and repair facility.  
                            The company has an expansive shipyard campus with large canal docking areas.  
                            The employees of the shipyard had to walk  long distances around the canal areas to 
                            get from one side of the yard to the other.  A permanent fixed bridge was too expensive, 
                            and would block the canal from vessel movement.  The solution was a solid cast concrete 
                            floating bridge, with a “swing section” to allow vessels to pass thru.  The wide floating 
                            bridge was  fitted multiple ramps for two way traffic, lights and railings to accommodate 
                            foot traffic , and small vehicle traffic. To accommodate vessels the systems also has HD D-Fender
                             and bollards.

                        <p>The Yorktown National park was in need of a large vessel pier for visiting transient 
                            boats as well as small cruise ships, and regional tour boats and tall ship.  
                            The Depth of the water and sharp drop from shore and fierce current created great 
                            expense and difficulty for a fixed pier solution.  SF Marina Systems and Coastal Design 
                            and construction developed a all floating system which could accommodate up to 400’ 
                            vessels with 55mph Squall conditions.  With 27 mile fetch the Systems regularly experiences a 6 ft wave.
