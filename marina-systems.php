                    <p>Our Marina Systems are a step above the typical wooden, aluminum or steel dock systems you’ve seen. With widths ranging from 8’ to 20’, lengths of up to 100’ and freeboard heights from 10” to 30”  it‘s an unsinkable solution.</p>
                    <p>We offer a complete line of all-concrete single cast designs with EPS Styrofoam core and protected steel reinforcement. The heavy mass of the concrete structure offers stability, longevity, low maintenance and accommodates high vessel and environmental forces, including high winds, waves and harsh winter ice. </p>
                    <p>It’s aesthetically pleasing to view and feel underfoot. Customizable with wood and composite treatments fenders and has a thick concrete deck surface to accomodate  internal utilities, lighting, high loading cleats and bollards and small cranes. If you can cast it into concrete we can design it in!</p>
