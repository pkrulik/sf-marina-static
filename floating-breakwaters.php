                             escape the issues of the tidal fluctuation, and improve the view  from the marina to the harbor.  
                             In addition greater attenuation of the wave condition was needed. Working within the existing permit 
                             lines, and with the enthusiastic do it your self club, a 3m wide floating breakwater was employed 
                             and design to attached member built wooden fingers on the back side.  The result was a cost effect 
                             systems that accomplished the goals of the club.

                        <p>Brewers Plymouth Marina had an ageing marina system that was repeatedly damaged in storm events 
                            creating a lot of maintenance, which was a major annual expense. Hurricane Sandy eventually 
                            destroyed the existing dock.  SF Marina systems provided a New Floating breakwater ready for the 
                            next spring opening.  Fitted with internal piles, and exterior piles the New System has seen multiple 
                            strong storms with no damage or maintenance issues for our system or the docks it protects.

                            The club membership wished to expand the docking area of the marina, to increase the amount of slips.  
                            The location had a clear 5-mile fetch, and opportunity for an exposer from the Atlantic Ocean thru the 
                            harbor opening. A wider floating breakwater was required.   The combination of the 5m wide floating 
                            breakwater and the heavy chain anchor system accomplished the goals.  One notable trait of the pile 
                            free system is the  clear views over the bay, and the ability to roll  large sails directly on the docks..
