                        <p>Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance Had a great Idea; Create a multi use dock which would 
                            welcome the community of bay ridge Brooklyn to water and provide access to all sizes 
                            of vessel.  The Community “eco dock” did just that.  School children from the local school 
                            have access to educational boat trips learning science, and new experiences. The project location 
                            was a challenge with Fast Currents, large wind driven waves and regular ferry wakes, which equaled 
                            never ending movement of the dock system. The System will stand on its own for many years of 
                            uninterrupted service.</p>

                        <p>Salt & Sill is an island inn with an international cuisine, which opened in 1999. Based on local raw 
                            materials and strong influences from the coast and the ocean, the restaurant offers high quality food 
                            in an inspiring setting during the summer. The operator desired a hotel, however lacked the land space 
                            to build one.  SF Marina Systms had the solution. In the autumn of 2008, Sweden’s first floating hotel 
                            open alongside the restaurant. The hotel is a meeting and conference venue with 46 beds, and open all 
                            year round. Salt & Sill has been awarded the status ‘Worth a Journey’ and ‘White’s Heart’ by White Guide, 
                            the Swedish Restaurant Guide, as well as the quality accreditation ‘Västsvensk Mersmak’ by the Tourist 
                            Board for the West of Sweden.
